# Project S.P.I.R.O.N

The project aims to address the challenges of financial and medical unpreparedness. The AI models will provide beneficial and helpful predictions while offering further insight. (More financial literacy resources and a message telling the user to seek professional medical care if they are worried about their health while offering them information to ease their mind or help them in some way).

The project hinges on the AI integration of approximately 8 - 10+ finance-related and healthcare models each into every aspect of our project. 
The project will consist of a web application, desktop application, and mobile application to be the nexus point for all of our AI models. 

The project will be made using Python, Mojo, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java.
